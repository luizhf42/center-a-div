## Technologies
This project is built with:
- [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org): my preferred front-end framework (and the one I have stronger skills), being very intuitive and enabling the creation of the front-end with ease, also with easy integration with Tailwind and TypeScript.
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com): to accelerate the development and ensure a consistent design, and its `@apply` at-rule works seamlessly with Vue's single file components.
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/): to ensure a safe and documented JS code, also with great IDE support.

## Installation
